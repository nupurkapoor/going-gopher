# Go Lang

This repo is dedicated to record documentation, tricks, and exercises followed during the

## Why Go
As per Go's official documentation:

Go is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming in mind.

Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language. It also aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing. Finally, working with Go is intended to be fast: it should take at most a few seconds to build a large executable on a single computer. To meet these goals required addressing a number of linguistic issues: an expressive but lightweight type system; concurrency and garbage collection; rigid dependency specification; and so on. These cannot be addressed well by libraries or tools; a new language was called for.

* It is possible to compile a large Go program in a few seconds on a single computer.
* Go provides a model for software construction that makes dependency analysis easy and avoids much of the overhead of C-style include files and libraries.
* Go's type system has no hierarchy, so no time is spent defining the relationships between types. Also, although Go has static types the language attempts to make types feel lighter weight than in typical OO languages.
* Go is fully garbage-collected and provides fundamental support for concurrent execution and communication.
* By its design, Go proposes an approach for the construction of system software on multicore machines.

#### Disclaimer!!!!!
Do not follow my directory naming conventions, the reason most of my directories follow a number_name format is because that ways it'll be easier to consider this repo as a starting point tutorial. So these numbers help index various topics, so you know that you should do varibles before scope, etc!
